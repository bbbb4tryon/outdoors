As a user of the Next.js application, I want to be able to search for destinations and view information about each destination, such as the current weather conditions and the weather forecast for the next few hours. I also want to be able to log my emotional and relaxation gauges after each activity, and have that data persist with my session or ID so that I can view it later. Additionally, I want the application to provide a smooth and interactive user experience with subtle animations and interactive elements that enhance the overall usability of the application.

signup.js:
fetch('/signupUser') to the backend
